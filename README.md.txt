# Titanic Data Visualization Project

This project explores the famous Titanic dataset using Python and Seaborn. It includes advanced visualizations to uncover insights about passenger survival based on different features.

## Dataset

The dataset is the Titanic passenger data, provided by the Seaborn library. It includes features like passenger class, sex, age, fare, and whether the passenger survived.

## Visualizations

- Survival rate by passenger class and sex  
- Age distribution by survival status  
- Fare distribution across passenger classes  
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features  
- Pairplot of features colored by survival  
- FacetGrid comparisons of survival by embarkation point and class

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.7+ recommended)  
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
